20250711-MTL: I've provided some data files. 

The simplest dataset files to work with are in the location: *data\children born per women*
            
Although, I will say that I had initally thought that it would be nice to have datasets that proivded information on potential connections and relationships on why birth rates may be declining. Most datasets on those are restricted. There are also a lot of data sets from the CDC website about national surveys. I pulled one, which is located in *data\National Survey of Family Growth*.

The other datasets I found require a lot of data cleaning, which may be time consuming to reference the data source code book and identify each individual variable.
